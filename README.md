# Neal's Jetpack Joyride
Welcome to my implementation of Jetpack Joyride! While I'm still tweaking some minor details / adding new features, the game is runnable and stellar! I hope you play and enjoy!

## Features:
- Random lasers
- Rocket motion tracking
- High score and lifetime score
- Pause menu with quit, resume, and restart

## Working on: 
- Music
- Sprite
- Power Ups (maybe...)
- Switch to OOP (maybe...)
